   <h2>Experience:</h2>
   <h3>Beat Writer</h3>
    <h4>WMUC Sports</h4>
    <h5>August 2022 – Present </h5>
    <p>At WMUC Sports I write game summaries for every basketball and football game. To do so, I attend every home game and watch every away game, as well as attend the post-game press conferences either in-person or over Zoom. I also write feature articles that discuss the overall state of the teams or any noticeable trends in the teams’ gameplay.</p>
    
    <h3>Writer</h3>
    <h4>Russell St. Report</h4>
    <h5>June 2022 – Present</h5>
    <p>At Russell St. Report, I put together opinion articles regarding the state of the Baltimore Ravens, as well as informational pieces that update readers on who the team added or dropped. On a week-to-week basis, I would provide predictions ahead of each Ravens game that would be compiled into a bigger article with other writers on the staff.</p>
    
    <h3>“Terps Watch” Writer</h3>
    <h4>The Diamondback</h4>
    <h5>December 2021 – March 2023</h5>
    <p>As a member of The Diamondback’s Terps Watch beat, I crafted articles that followed former Maryland athletes in their professional sports leagues. One example of my work was covering former Terps that played in the NFL on a week-to-week basis, providing outlooks of their performances ahead of each game. I would also create “how-to-watch” articles for readers to learn how to catch Maryland athletic events.</p>
